We introduce ELA-ZSON, an efficient layout-aware zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) approach designed for complex multi-room indoor environments. 

By planning hierarchically leveraging a global topology map with layout information and detailed scene representation memory, ELA-ZSON achieves both efficient and effective navigation. The process is managed by an LLM-powered agent, ensuring seamless operation from exploration to navigation, without the need for human interaction, complex rewards, or costly training. 

Our experimental results on the HM3D benchmark demonstrate a 16.7\% point improvement in navigation success rate and 12\% improvement in success rate weighted by path length compared to SOTA methods. Furthermore, we validate the robustness of our approach through real-world robotic deployment, showcasing its capability in practical scenarios.
